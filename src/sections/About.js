          <p>
            A third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at VIT
            Vellore, and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect &mdash; Associate.
            I specialize in full-stack web development, mobile application
            development, and scalable backend systems. My core tech stack
            includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js,
            Flutter, and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            With hands-on experience in real-world projects—ranging from a
            collaborative story-writing platform and news apps to CRM and ERP
            systems during my internship at Nepbyte Technologies—I've built
            systems that are both user-friendly and production-ready. I've also
            developed tools like a bulk emailer using Nodemailer and a
            Crunchyroll clone with Next.js and TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actively participate in hackathons and continuously upskill with a
            strong interest in open-source contribution, particularly aiming to
            contribute to Webpack. I'm driven by a passion for problem-solving,
            cloud architecture, and creating impactful digital products.
